  <h3>Personal Bio</h3>
  <p>
 	In 2015, after nearly four years working for the company, David Breitenbeck made the decision
 	to quit his comfortable administrative job and attempt a career in freelance writing. Over the 
 	next several years, he doggedly pursued his goal, while supplementing his income with a series of 
 	odd jobs; retail, barista, security guard, and so on. 
  </p>
  <p>
	Despite some successes and the promise of more, the desire for structure, security, and 
	a new challenge led him to turn back to the world of regular work. Coding, with its blend of creativity, 
	logic, and continual growth caught his eye, and he enrolled in Grand Circus for winter 2020.
